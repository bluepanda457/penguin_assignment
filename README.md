This repository plots a linear regression model between bill length and flipper length using data from the Palmer Penguins dataset.

To run this analysis, run the penguins_assignment.Rmd document.


The raw data is within the 'data_raw' directory and the clean data is within the 'data_clean' directory.

The functions used are held within the 'functions' directory. The 'plotting.R' script contains functions used to plot the figure for Question 02, and the 'plotting_regression.R' script contains functions used in Question 04.

The final figure to represent the linear regression model is held within the 'figures' directory.
